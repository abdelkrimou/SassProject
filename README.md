# My First Sass Project

Welcome to my first project using the Sass framework!

## Overview

This project marks my initial exploration into the world of Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets). It's a simple project to get hands-on experience with Sass features, syntax, and creating a fully responsive web design.
